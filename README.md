# Prediction-using-UnSupervised-Machine-Learning

Problem Statement - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of  clusters and represent it visually

This simple project comes under Unsupervised Mahchine Learning &  uses K-Means clustering algorithm.


following Steps are required for Predict the optimum number of Clusters and Visualization.

Step 1- Import the required libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn and Sklearn'.
Step 2- Read the csv data. 
Step 3- calculate the Within cluster sum of squares(wcss).
Step 4- Plot the elbow graph & select the number of clusters.
Step 5- Fit the model & predict it using K-Means.
Step 6- Plot a Scatter graph for the clusters.
